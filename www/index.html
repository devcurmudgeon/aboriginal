<b><h1>News</h1></b>

<h2>January 14, 2007</h2>
<p>There's a new irc channel for the project, #firmware on freenode.</p>

<p><a href=http://landley.net/hg/firmware?cl=88>Changeset 88</a> builds
i686, x86_64, armv4l, mips, and sparc.  I've made a release tarball of
that (<a href=downloads/firmware-0.1.1.tar.bz2>firmware 0.1.1</a>, "It works
for me"), and updated the prebuilt cross-compiler tarballs in the
<a href=downloads>downloads</a> directory.  I've added a big README and
prebuilt mini-native tarballs for each platform (although packing them up into
something qemu can boot is currently left as an exercise for the reader).</p>

<p>Speaking of which, I'm currently working on adding ext2 packaging
(via <a href=http://landley.net/code/toybox>toybox</a>) to the build scripts,
so qemu system emulation can boot the result and then run the next stage
automatically.</p>

<h2>December 28, 2006</h2>
<p><a href=http://landley.net/hg/firmware?cl=68>Changeset 68</a> builds
a native build environment with a working toolchain.  And in celebration, I've
revamped the website with an actual navigation bar and content and such.</p>

<p>I should put out a release soon.</p>

<h2>December 5, 2006</h2>
<p><a href=http://landley.net/hg/firmware?cl=27>Changeset 27</a> builds
a relocatable armv4l cross-compile toolchain!  Download the tarball,
run ./download.sh, then run ./build.sh, then grab the "build/cross-compiler"
directory and use "bin/armv4l-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc" out of that (which
I admit is a bit of a mouthful, for which I blame the FSF).</p>

<h2>August 6, 2006</h2>
<p>Mecurial repository created.  Nothing to see yet, move along...</p>
