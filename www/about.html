<h2>What is Firmware Linux?</h2>

<p>Firmware Linux is build system that produces a bootable single file linux
system for various hardware platforms.  Along the way, the build produces a
<a href=downloads/cross-compiler>relocatable cross compiler for the target
hardware</a>, and also a <a href=downloads/mini-native>native build
environment</a>.</p>

<p>The build system is a series of shell scripts, which download, compile,
and use the appropriate source packages to generate the output files.  These
shell scripts are written to be easily read and modified.</p>

<p>The system built by these scripts consists of the following source
packages:</p>

<ul>
<li>linux 2.6.21</li>
<li>busybox 1.2.2</li>
<li>uclibc 0.9.29</li>
<li>gcc 4.1.2</li>
<li>binutils 2.17</li>
<li>make 3.81</li>
<li>bash 2.05 b</li>
</ul>

<!-- >[Note: this paragraph is a TODO item.] The final Firmware Linux image is one
file containing a kernel,
initramfs,
read-only root filesystem, and cryptographic signature.  You can boot Linux
from this file as if it was a normal kernel image.  (A slightly modified LILO
is used to do this on x86.  Patches for other bootloaders are a to-do item.)
You can upgrade your entire OS (and any applications in the root filesystem)
atomically, by downloading a new file and pointing your bootloader at it. -->

<h2>How do I use it?</h2>

<p><b>build.sh</b>: Start here.  This is the master script which runs all the
other build stages.  It takes one argument, the platform to build for.  (Run it
with no arguments to see a list of supported platforms.)  The individual stage
scripts can also be run individually, with the same argument as build.sh.</p>

<p><b>download.sh</b>: This script checks the sources/packages directory for
source tarballs, and downloads any that are missing or have invalid SHA1
checksums.  It also deletes any old files in sources/packages not used by the
current build version, and populates sources/build-links with
version-independent symlinks for use by later build stages.</p>

<p><b>cross-compiler.sh</b>: This script produces a cross compiler for the
indicated target platform.  The working copy is produced in the build
directory, and a copy is saved as "cross-compiler-$ARCH.tar.bz2" for use
outside the build system.  This cross compiler is fully relocatable (using the
wrapper script in sources/toys/gcc-uClibc.c), so and any normal user can
extract it into their home directory, add cross-compiler-$ARCH/bin to their
$PATH, and run $ARCH-gcc to create target binaries.  It contains gcc, binutils,
linux kernel headers, and the uClibc C library.</p>

<p>The cross compiler script also builds squashfs tools, a target platform
emulator (QEMU), and uses the emulator to confirm that the cross compiler
works.  This script can take an optional first argument, <b>--short</b>, to
skip those steps.  This is useful if you want to build several cross compilers
without multiple copies of QEMU.  (The short build will also delete the
build/cross-compiler-$ARCH directory after tarring it up, since the result
isn't usable by later build stages.)</p>

<p><b>mini-native.sh</b>: This script uses the cross compiler to create
a minimal native build environment for the target platfrom.  This native
environment consists of just seven packages: busybox, uClibc, the linux kernel,
gcc, binutils, make, and bash.  This is a fully self-hosting development
environment, capable of rebuilding itself from source code, organized as a
<a href=http://www.linuxfromscratch.org>Linux From Scratch</a> /tools
directory.  It also produces a bootable Linux kernel for the target platform,
and packages the /tools directory as a squashfs image for use by QEMU.</p>

<p><b>package-mini-native.sh</b>: This script creates an ext2 filesystem image
for use with qemu.  It currently does this using a User Mode Linux image
created by the host-tools.sh script.</p>
