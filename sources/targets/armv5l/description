ARM v5, little endian, EABI with vector floating point (vfp).

This is the "pentium" of arm.  Again, most modern arm hardware should be
able to run this.

Hardware that supports the v5 instruction set should run this about 25% faster
than code compiled for v4, without consuming noticeably more electricity to do
so.
