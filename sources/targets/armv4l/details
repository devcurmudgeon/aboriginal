# ARM v4, little endian, soft float.
#
# This is an extremely generic arm image that should run on any arm hardware
# still in use today.  It's the i386 of arm.

# Note: ARMv5 can run ARMv4, ARMv6 can run ARMv5, and so on.  Each new
# architecture is a superset of the old ones, and the main reason to compile
# for newer platforms is speed.  (ARMv5 code runs about 25% faster than
# ARMv4 code on hardware that can handle it.)  The oldest architecture this
# goes back to is ARMv3 (which introduced 32-bit addressing), but that
# hardware is obsolete (not just no longer being sold, but mostly cycled out
# of the installed base).
