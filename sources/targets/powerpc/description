Power PC, 32 bit

Generic Power PC system, a basic unoptimized instruction set which
just about any powerpc should be able to run.

The main exceptions are the 440 and 880 lines, which were stripped down
versions of the powerpc (created by IBM and Motorola, respectively) targetted
at battery powered devices such as cell phones.  They do not support the entire
powerpc instruction set.  (Alas, the two chose _different_ subsets, so they
don't run each other's code either.  The 880 is mostly dead today, but the
440 is alive and well.)
