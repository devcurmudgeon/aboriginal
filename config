# Setup

# This file is a place for you to set configuration values.  This entire
# file is optional; by default all the variables documented in this file
# are left blank by the build.  Feel free to replace this file with your
# own version, or to set these as environment variables on the command line.

# By default mini-native.sh will build a native toolchain (binutils, gcc,
# make, bash, distcc).  Set this variable to "none" to skip all that, and
# build a root filesystem containing only uClibc and busybox.  You can also
# set it to "headers" to retain the linux/uClibc kernel headers (in case you'd
# like to build your own native toolchain based on a different compiler).

# export NATIVE_TOOLCHAIN=none
# export NATIVE_TOOLCHAIN=headers

# If this is set, mini-native will build a Linux From Scratch style /tools
# directory instead of a more conventional filesystem layout in /usr.

# export NATIVE_TOOLSDIR=1

# If this is set, the build records the command lines run by each build into
# log files in the build directory, ala "build/cmdlines.$PACKAGENAME"

# export RECORD_COMMANDS=1

# If this is set, the cross-compiler stage is compiled with --static.

# export CROSS_BUILD_STATIC=1

# This may be set by the target's "details" file, but you can override it here.
# You can set it to ext2, initramfs, or squashfs.  It defaults to ext2 if blank.

# export SYSIMAGE_TYPE=ext2

# If this is set, try downloading packages from this location first.

# export PREFERRED_MIRROR=http://landley.net/code/firmware/mirror

# If this is set, the toybox utilities will take precedence over busybox ones.

# export USE_TOYBOX=1

# Try development versions of these packages.  (Know what you're doing if
# you select these, it's quite possible the result won't work.)

# export USE_UNSTABLE=uClibc,busybox,toybox,linux,binutils,make,gcc-core,gcc-g++

# Debugging option to leave source in build/temp-$ARCH after build.
# export NO_CLEANUP=1

# If this is set, the output of the various stages will be color coded.
# export USE_COLOR=1

  # If you'd like to change colors, do so here.
