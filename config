# Setup

# If this is set, mini-native won't include development tools, just uClibc
# and busybox.  (Set it to "headers" to include kernel headers if you'd like
# to add your own toolchain, such as tinycc.)

# export NATIVE_NOTOOLCHAIN=1
# export NATIVE_NOTOOLCHAIN=headers

# If this is set, mini-native will built a more conventional filesystem layout
# instead of a Linux From Scratch style /tools directory.

# export NATIVE_NOTOOLSDIR=1

# If this is set, the build records the command lines run by each build into
# log files in the build directory, ala "build/cmdlines.$PACKAGENAME"

# export RECORD_COMMANDS=1

# If this is set, the cross-compiler stage is compiled with --static.

# export BUILD_STATIC=1

# If this is set, try downloading packages from this location first.

# export PREFERRED_MIRROR=http://landley.net/code/firmware/mirror

# If this is set, the toybox utilities will take precedence over busybox ones.

# export USE_TOYBOX=1

# Try development versions of these packages

# export USE_UNSTABLE=uClibc,busybox,toybox

# If you'd like to change colors, do so here.  If you want to eliminate colors,
# comment these out.
